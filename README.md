: Erik's dotfiles

[Forked from mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) 

This repo is mostly for me, hopefully I can get it to work for windows.

So far I've mixed and tailored the scripts based on the following other repos

* [paulirish / dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles "dotfiles")
* [igetgames / dotfiles](https://github.com/igetgames/dotfiles "dotfiles")
